## opps With javascript 

- Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.
- paradigm means how we write and organize a code in a program 
- In Object-oriented programming, we represent real-world entities as an object.

### example-001

```

let user = {
    name:'John',
    role:'admin',
    access:'read-write'
}

addUser(){
    //Logic to add user
}

removeUser(){
    //Logic to remove user
}

```
- representing a real user as an object 
- An object can have **data** and **behavier**

- The properties of an object called data

### example-001-1

```
name:'John',
role:'admin',
access:'read-write'
```
 
- Methods of an object called it's **behavier**

### example-001-2

```
addUser(){
    //Logic to add user
},
removeUser(){
    //Logic to remove user
}

```

***We use Objects to pack data and behavier of real-world entity all in big block**

- Objects are self contained piece or block of code and we use them as building block of our application and makes them interact with one another.
